# Introduction and Objectives

## background to the problem

* Importance of growth models
* Noisy environment - Systematic error
* Classification using Bayes factor - e.g. See for a dataset classified as linear which model seems to fit (frequentist) better which will be selected by BF and by how much

## Reasons for the choice of project

* Application in biology and economics

* Contribution to literature as unexplored method - combination of Bayes factor and Harris paper

* Study of noise to signal ratio in classification

## Identification of the projectâ€™s beneficiaries

* Commercial partner (probably not)
* Literature as an empirical analysis of Bayesian classification of growth using different models

## Objectives and metrics

* A Classification framework which should include :
  *A classification between different models
  *The "certainty" of classification - TBD how we can quantify this
  *An estimation of the parameters of the model - with the "certainty" of estimation
  *An identification of the systematic error

## Broad methods and how they answer goal

* Curve fitting : 
  *Fit a linear and a logistic and classify depending on the error. See how as you increase the variance of the error, the classification changes 

* Bayesian approach : 

  *Estimate the distribution of the parameters (we should get the "certainty" from here) of a Bayesian linear regression, sigmoid function and then add the algorithm set by Harris (his calculation was for a sigmoid. Might have to do it for a linear regression) and compare the models using Bayes factor. 

  *Does the model that fits the most correspond to the correct functional form? 
  
  *See if as you change error the systematic error is caught by the Harris algo and how the model selection varies

* Compare the two approches : how do they compare ? From there
